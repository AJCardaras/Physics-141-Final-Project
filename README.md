# Physics-141-Final-Project

This python script makes use of the numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, IPython.display, and os packages. Please ensure that these are imported prior to trying to run the code.

This code simulates the Fisher-KPP equation for the propagation of waves using Runge Kutta 4. Visualizations of the results can be found in the animation.gif (1 dimension), Disk_animation.gif (2 dimension disk), and line_animation.gif (2 dimension line). 

In order to create the .gif files multiple .png files are saved then compiled to form a .mp4 file using ffmpeg, then the .mp4 file is converted into a .gif file.
